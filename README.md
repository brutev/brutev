👋 Hey, I'm Vignesh
Flutter/Dart developer from Chennai, building real‑world mobile apps and leveling up into Python‑backed systems and APIs.​
Enjoy working end‑to‑end: from pixel‑perfect UIs to clean architecture and backend services that are easy to reason about and extend.


​🧭 What I Do
Build production-style Flutter apps (widgets, navigation, state management with Provider/Cubit, async, clean architecture).
Write Python for scripting, automation, and exploring backend services and APIs.
Refactor codebases to be more modular, testable, and maintainable over time.


🚀 What I’m Learning Now
Backend systems with Python: HTTP APIs, authentication, database access, and basic deployment.
Core backend concepts: RESTful design, data modeling, caching, logging, and observability.
Better project structure: separating domains, services, and infrastructure for clearer ownership and easier scaling.


📌 Featured Projects
📱 Pocket Financier (Flutter)
Personal finance companion exploring spending, investing, and insights.
Flutter app with clean architecture, state management, and async data flows.
Focus on clear UI structure, testable business logic, and strong Git practices (GPG, push protection, secret‑safe history).


🛠 Tech Stack
Languages: Dart, Python, Java/C#, JavaScript (early), SQL.
Mobile: Flutter, widgets, layouts, navigation, Provider/Cubit state management, async/Streams.
Backend (learning): Python (FastAPI / Flask style APIs), REST, DB access, basic Docker & deployment.
Tools: Git & GitHub, GPG‑signed commits, GitHub Actions, VS Code/Android Studio, Postman/HTTP clients.


🌱 How I Like to Build
Prefer small, composable units: features broken into clear widgets, services, and data layers.
Focus on readability, naming, and predictable state over “clever” one‑liners.
Enjoy refactoring and documenting projects so others can onboard quickly and extend them safely.
