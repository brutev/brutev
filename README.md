👋 Hey, I'm Vignesh


Flutter/Dart developer from Chennai, building real‑world mobile apps and leveling up into Python‑backed systems and APIs.



​🧭 What I Do
Build production-style Flutter apps (widgets, navigation, state management with Provider/Cubit, async, clean architecture).

Write Python for scripting, automation, and exploring backend services and APIs.



🚀 What I’m Learning Now
Backend systems with Python: HTTP APIs, authentication, database access, and basic deployment.

Core backend concepts: RESTful design, data modeling, caching, logging, and observability.

Better project structure: separating domains, services, and infrastructure for clearer ownership and easier scaling.


📌 Featured Projects

Mobile: Flutter

Backend (learning): Python (FastAPI / Flask style APIs), REST, DB access, basic Docker & deployment.

Tools: Git & GitHub, GPG‑signed commits, GitHub Actions, VS Code/Android Studio, Postman/HTTP clients.
